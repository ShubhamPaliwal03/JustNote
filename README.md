## JustNote is a feature rich, GUI based Notepad Application Developed using Swing Framework in Java.

# Running the Java Application

This guide will help you set up and run the Java application on your machine by cloning the repository.

## Prerequisites

- Ensure you have **Java 8 or above** installed on your machine.
  - **Swing** was introduced in **Java 1.2**. However, we recommend using **Java 8 or higher** for better compatibility and performance.

### Check Java Version

You can check your installed Java version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
java -version
```

If Java is not installed, download it from [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).

## Steps to Run the Application

Here’s an example of the steps to run the Java application:

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ShubhamPaliwal03/JustNote.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd JustNote
   ```

3. **Compile the Java Files:**

   ```bash
   javac JustNote.java
   ```

4. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   java JustNote
   ```

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure that **Java** is correctly installed and available in your system’s `PATH`.
- If compilation errors occur, check that all required `.java` files are present and located correctly in the `src` directory.
- For runtime errors, verify that the correct `JustNote` class is being used and its package structure matches your project structure.
